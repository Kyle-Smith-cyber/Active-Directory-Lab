# Active Directory Lab – Windows Server & Windows 10

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to build a virtual Active Directory (AD) environment for hands-on learning in network and system administration. The lab involves **Windows Server 2016** as a Domain Controller and **Windows 10** clients, with a focus on configuring AD services, managing users and groups, applying Group Policies, and controlling file share permissions.

This project simulates a small enterprise environment and demonstrates practical skills in network configuration, user management, and domain-based security controls.

**Components Involved:**
- **Windows Server 2016** – AD Domain Controller (DC), DNS, DHCP  
- **Windows 10** – Client machine (joined to the AD domain)  
- **Internal Network (VirtualBox Host-Only)** – Simulated LAN for AD communication  
- **Group Policies (GPOs)** – Password policies, account lockout policies  
- **File Shares** – Controlled access based on AD groups

## Conclusion
This lab demonstrates the creation and configuration of a **Windows Server 2019 Active Directory environment** with domain-joined Windows 10 clients.  

**Skills demonstrated:**
- AD DS installation and configuration  
- DNS and DHCP setup  
- User and group management  
- Group Policy application for security enforcement  
- Controlled access to file shares  

This project strengthened my practical skills in **Windows Server administration**, **enterprise networking**, and **security best practices**.
