# Active Directory Lab – Windows Server & Windows 10

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to build a virtual Active Directory (AD) environment for hands-on learning in network and system administration. The lab involves **Windows Server 2016** as a Domain Controller and **Windows 10** clients, with a focus on configuring AD services, managing users and groups, applying Group Policies, and controlling file share permissions.

This project simulates a small enterprise environment and demonstrates practical skills in network configuration, user management, and domain-based security controls.
